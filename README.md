# Numerical Methods
## An HSSP Spring Course

**Difficulty:** High.

**Required Knowledge:**
- Middle school algebra.
- *If you wish to do homework* you should know Python. You would probably be fine with MATLAB, C++, or C#, but all code here will be written in Python with the packages `numpy, scipy, matplotlib,` and `jupyter`.

# Schedule

1. The derivative, fixed point iteration, Newton's method, Euler, Runge-Kutta, and multistep methods.
2. Quadrature a.k.a. numerical integration, finite difference methods and correctors.
3.  Linear differential equations, matrix fundamentals, the QR algorithm, Newton-like methods, stiffness.
4. Finite element methods, various bases, Fourier/DCT transforms, Fourier analysis (faster solvers), Fourier analysis (stability).
5. Optimization: Binary and golden-section search, the simplex method, gradient descent, conjugate gradient descent, and Adam.
6. Stable diffusion.
